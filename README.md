To run this app on a Mac in VSCode:
    - Install node if necessary
        - Use `brew install nvm` and then `nvm install 20`, to get node v20
        - Pay attention to the change that has to be made to your bash/zshrc file after brew install nvm - it'll tell you what to paste in there
    - Run `npm start`
